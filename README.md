# ReadTime
===============
ReadTime is a Chrome extension that allows a user to simply click on the icon and see the estimated reading time for the article or webpage that they are currently viewing.
ReadTime takes into account the headings and pictures within the article and estimates the final time for that entire page.

Future Ideas
---------------
> * Add a share article Button
> * Add options for how to calculate time (ex. Do Not Include Picture Time)
> * Allow users to have a timer so they can see how long it actually takes them
